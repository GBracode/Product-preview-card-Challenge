## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### Continued development

I still need to put more time to CSS styles. I havent felt comfident enough to carry on with everything by myself. There are things that even tho i know how to applythem, if i dont see a moch or something as a guide i cant get to the result i expect. Specially with responsiveness.

## Acknowledgments

At first i did styled with CSS Grid, but found its more intuitive for me to use flexbox.
